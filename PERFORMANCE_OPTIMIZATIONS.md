# Performance Optimizations Summary

## Memory Leak Fixes

### 1. Event Listener Cleanup
- Fixed event listeners not being removed in GameScene shutdown
- Added proper cleanup for contextmenu, P key, and socket handlers
- Fixed window resize handlers in UI components

### 2. Timeout and Interval Management
- Implemented centralized timeout/interval tracking with arrays
- All timeouts/intervals are now cleared on shutdown
- Fixed accumulating setTimeout calls in various components

### 3. DOM Element Cleanup
- Fixed style elements being repeatedly created without cleanup
- Added ID checks to prevent duplicate style elements
- Proper removal of all style elements on shutdown

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Object Allocation Reduction
- Pre-allocated input objects in GameScene to avoid GC pressure
  - `_deadInput` and `_aliveInput` objects reused every frame
- Cached DOM elements to avoid repeated lookups
- Implemented texture state tracking to avoid redundant switches

### 2. Console.log Removal
- Removed all console.log statements from hot paths:
  - Update loops
  - Render functions
  - Input handling
  - NPC rendering

### 3. Object Pooling
- Implemented BulletPool for efficient bullet management
- Pre-allocates 50 regular bullets and 10 tomato bullets
- Reuses inactive bullets instead of creating new ones
- Reduces garbage collection pressure significantly

### 4. Sky Rendering Optimization
- Sky only updates when time changes significantly (>0.01 units)
- Reduced gradient band calculations
- Cached last sky time to avoid redundant updates

### 5. Network Optimizations
- Forced WebSocket-only transport (no polling)
- Input rate limiting to 20Hz instead of 60Hz
- Connection quality monitoring with automatic recovery
- Removed compression for lower latency

### 6. Sprite and Texture Management
- Implemented texture state caching to avoid redundant setTexture calls
- Only update sprite properties when they actually change
- Optimized flipX state management

## Results

These optimizations address:
- Memory leaks causing performance degradation over time
- Excessive garbage collection from object allocations
- CPU overhead from redundant operations
- Network latency and rubberbanding issues

The game should now maintain stable performance even after extended play sessions.
